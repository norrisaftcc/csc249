Assignment

Create a video game inventory shop system using linked lists. The system should allow players to purchase items such as swords, potions, and armor from the shop, view their inventory, and sell items back to the shop. The system should also calculate the total cost of the items in the player's inventory.

Requirements

    The program should be implemented in Python using linked lists.

    The program should have a menu system that allows the player to choose from the following options:
        Purchase an item
        View inventory
        Sell an item
        View total inventory value
        Exit the program

    When purchasing an item, the program should prompt the player for the item name and price.

    When viewing the player's inventory, the program should display the item name, quantity, and value for each item in the inventory.

    When selling an item back to the shop, the program should prompt the player for the name of the item to sell and the quantity to sell.

    When viewing the total inventory value, the program should display the total value of all items in the player's inventory.
