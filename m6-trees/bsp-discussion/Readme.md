earlier 3d - compare
dungeons of daggorath (color computer)

Notes on algo types:
shredded nerd doom binary space partitioning video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYMZsMMlubg
12:50 is intro to discussion of painters algorithm vs. raycasting (covered earlier for wolf3d) vs BSP
also mentions warnock's algorithm (which is front to back) -- subdivides below pixel size
z-buffer (per pixel)
the actual solution is z-buffer with binary space partitioning tree
draw closest to furthest, with no overdraw
